# üìö Exploring Computer Vision Tasks with YOLO


- In the previous article, we discussed how **CLIP** bridges **text and images** by mapping them into a shared embedding space.
- You can read more about it here: [CLIP: How AI Connects Text and Images Without Explicit Labels](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/clip-how-ai-connects-text-images-without-explicit-yabut-meng-ai-wg9wf)
- This allowed us to classify images based on their similarity to textual descriptions, showcasing an exciting intersection between vision and language.

## Introducing Computer Vision

- What we explored with CLIP is part of a broader field in AI called **Computer Vision (CV)**.
- Computer Vision focuses on enabling machines to **"see"** and **understand visual information** similarly to how humans do.
- While CLIP demonstrated one task (classification), CV encompasses **many more tasks** beyond simple object recognition.

## What Will We Cover in This Notebook?

- In this notebook, we will dive deeper into the world of Computer Vision.
- We'll explore the different **core tasks** that CV models can perform, aside from object classification.
- To make it practical and hands-on, we will use models from the **YOLO family** as our tool for demonstration.

## Beyond Image Classification

- Modern Computer Vision can:
  - **Object Detection**: Detect multiple objects within a single image.
  - **Segmentation**: Segment individual objects at the pixel level.
  - **Pose Estimation**: Estimate human poses and body keypoints.
  - **Oriented Bounding Box (OBB)**: Recognize and handle rotated or oriented objects.

## Why YOLO Models?

- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** is not just a single model ‚Äî it is a **family of models**.
- Different versions and variants of YOLO are capable of handling various **Computer Vision tasks**.
- The YOLO family is known for:
  - Real-time performance.
  - High versatility across tasks such as detection, segmentation, pose estimation, and more.
  - High speed and competitive accuracy, even on resource-limited devices.
- Thanks to its continuous innovation, YOLO remains one of the most popular and practical choices for real-world applications.

## Topics We'll Explore

Using YOLO models, we will cover:
